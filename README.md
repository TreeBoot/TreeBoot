## About Me

I'm a passionate developer and firefighter enthusiast who loves to explore the realms of technology. When I'm not coding, you can find me at my local fire department ðŸš’, or perhaps lost in a good book.

## Projects

Here's a sneak peek into some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

- **[Public Discord Bot](https://github.com/TreeBoot/UKBRP-x-Main-Discord-Bot)**: A cool Discord Bot with many cool commands.

And many more to explore! Each project comes with its own set of challenges and learnings, and I'm always open to feedback or suggestions.

## Technologies I Love

- JavaScript: I like the ways I can use JavaScript in. to code Discord Bots, give websites functions and much more.
- ReactJs: I like the easiness I can create cool and stunning Websites in.
